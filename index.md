### [Assignment 6](https://yanouy.github.io/a6_pages.github.io/)
**Homework6 Description:** In this assignment you will visualize historical US election data and unemployment rates across US counties using choropleths. You will create three 3x2 panels of choropleths, one each for Texas, California and Pennsylvania. The rows will correspond to the years 2008, 2012 and 2016, and the columns will correspond to the percent of the vote received either the Democratic or Republican candidate for president (your choice), and the unemployment rate in that year.

### [Assignment 7](https://yanouy.github.io/a7_pages.github.io/)
**Homework7 Description:** In this assignment you will visualize the flow of people between different states in the United States over the period of one year, using network graphs.

You are required to choose New York, Texas and two other states as the origin states (where people lived the previous year) for this visualization, and show graphically the relative numbers of people that moved to the top 10 destination states (current state, in the data set) from each of the origin states. You are expected to create a single graphic for this project. For clarity, for each origin state, you will find the top 10 states that people moved to from that state in the year in question, and the union of those states will be represented as nodes in the graph. You will not consider migrations to other countries or US Territories (Puerto Rico, Guam and others), but only consider migrations to the 50 states and District of Columbia.


### [Final Project](https://yanouy.github.io/.)
**Final Project Description:** In the final project, firstly I investigate the relationship between housing prices and electricity consumption. And then towards LA, I explore the geo distribution housing values and population and the housing values with ocean distance. Besides, I generate wordcloud graph from housing prices news which hightlight keywords in this field.
